# Marble Spins: technical documentation

This is the starting point for anyone taking over the code, such as a future CTO. It is kept up to date with the code: every change that alters how something works updates the matching document in the same commit. Each document is also mirrored in the claude.ai project "Marble Race", under `cto/`.

| # | Document | What it answers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Architecture](01-architecture.md) | The parts (website, server, database, payments, apps), how they talk to each other, environments and variables |
| 2 | [Code map](02-code-map.md) | Where everything is in the repository, and where to look to fix something |
| 3 | [Data model](03-data-model.md) | Every database table and column; how the coin ledger and First Editions work |
| 4 | [Game and economy rules](04-game-rules.md) | How a race is decided, skill, coins, prices, fairness checks, in plain English |
| 5 | [Operations runbook](05-runbook.md) | Deploying, data updates, rollback, backups, the admin 2-step reset, Stripe test/live, the Android release and Google Play Billing setup, common problems |
| 6 | [Decisions log](06-decisions.md) | Key decisions, with the date and the reason for each |
| 7 | [Known gaps and roadmap](07-gaps-roadmap.md) | What isn't built or isn't finished yet |

**Other documentation in the repository:**
- `README.md`: the server's REST and socket API reference.
- `client/README.md`: the client and the apps.
- `client/APP-TESTING.md`: running the apps on your own phone.
- `src/tracks/README.md`: the track kit, for building new tracks.
- `store-assets/README.md`: the App Store and Google Play screenshots and feature graphic.
- `docs/database_schema.sql`: the schema itself, with comments.

**Conventions used in these documents:**
- Paths are relative to the repository root.
- "The server" means the Node app in `src/`. There is no `server/` folder: the server sits at the top level of the repository, next to `client/`.
- Variables are named but their values are never written here. Values live only in Railway, Vercel, Stripe and Google Play Console. The Android upload key lives only on Moses's computer and its backups.
